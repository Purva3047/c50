            <ul>
                <li>“Giant panda” is actually just a nickname for a panda; they are no specifically larger than others.</li>
                <li>Pandas eat consistently for 12-14 hours a day!</li>
                <li>Adult panda bears can weigh as much as 45 kilos (100 pounds).</li>
                <li>Like other bears, pandas can swim! They do not, however, hibernate, as they are unable to store energy over long periods of time (hence their 12-hour eating routine). </li>
                <li>Pandas, although native to China, are one of the few indigenous wildlife species that were never hunted for use in traditional Chinese medicine.</li>
                <li>Newborn pandas are pink!</li>
                <li>Panda cubs can be as small as a stick of butter- they are approximately 1/900th the size of their mother at birth.</li>
