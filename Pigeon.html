            <ul>
                <li>During the First World War a pigeon named Cher Ami (dear friend) saved the lives of many French soldiers by carrying a message across enemy lines in the heat of battle.</li>
                <li>Another heroic pigeon named G.I. Joe saved the lives of a thousand soldiers in World War 2 after British troops had established a position within an Italian town that was due to be bombed by allied planes.</li>
                <li>The feral pigeon that we see in our towns and cities today is descended from the rock dove (Columba livia), a cliff-dwelling bird historically found in coastal regions.</li>
                <li>The pigeon has side-mounted eyes, unlike humans and owls which have forward facing eyes.</li>
                <li>The first organised pigeon airmail service was started in 1896 between New Zealand and the Great Barrier Island. </li>
                <li>The pigeon mates for life and can breed up to 8 times a year in optimum conditions, bringing two young into the world each time. </li>
                <li>Both parents feed the young with a special ‘pigeon milk’ that is regurgitated and fed to the squabs. </li>
